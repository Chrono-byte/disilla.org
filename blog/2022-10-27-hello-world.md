Finally got around to putting this old website together. It is powered by Eleventy, which means there is a base template and then subsequent pages are generated from Markdown files or HTML should I need more power.

I chose this way of running it to allow flexibility. I can write in Markdown, HTML, or even JavaScript if I want to. I can also use Nunjucks for templating, which is a nice way to keep things organized.
