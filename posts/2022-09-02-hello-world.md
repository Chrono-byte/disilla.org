I finally got around to creating this blog! It took me longer than I thought it would, even considering the parenting, house-spousing, depression, and curve balls in life.

## Landing page

The landing page for the website was ready around the beginning of July. The pixel art was initially actual images enlarged with `image-rendering: pixelated` and `image-rendering: crisp-edges`, which meant the HTML was smaller and cleaner, however, the sword hilt and tip had alignment issues with the navbar blade. My CSS-fu was too weak to fix it. Toward the end of the month I re-created the images with CSS Flex and one div per pixel. It made the HTML way longer, but there are no alignment issues, and I like it much better this way.

Here are the images I drew to plan my landing page:

The mobile view was initially supposed to change the sword to a shield to fit in however many nav elements I would have to add. I'll probably do that in the future, since they seem to fit in the sword in all my tests so far.

## Blog page

I spent a very long time looking at [various blogs](https://drewdevault.com/make-a-blog) to find a design that I might like. It didn't happen. My brain wasn't cooperating with an original design either, so I did what I do whenever something like this happens. I looked at some tutorials to get [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) set up, created some sample blog posts with different markdown elements, then got around to styling it by trial-and-error. Eventually, I ended up with something that I felt was good enough to publish. If you're reading this post in August 2022, you're probably seeing one of its first published iterations. It will definitely change over time as I get feedback about it, and I'm super excited about it!

## Future plans

As of this moment, only the [landing page](/) and the [blog page](/blog) are implemented. The projects, miscellaneous, and about pages are next in line, and should be done by the end of the month!
