<p>
    I'm writing this site to document my thoughts and ideas. I'm not sure what
    I'll write about, but I'm sure I'll have something to say. I also am using
    it as a test bed for some ideas I have about how to build a in a simple way
    compared to the current state of React-based, Bootstrap-based, or other
    frameworks.
</p>
<p>
    Now with that out of the way, let's get into the meat of this post. I'm
    going to get into some of the recent ongoings in my life and what I've been
    thinking about.
</p>
<h2>The Past</h2>
<p>
    I've just wrapped up my final reason in VRC. We managed to place relatively
    well at state after a well-executed mid-season rebuild in February. I'm not
    sure what I'll do as a hobby-type thing until school's out.
</p>
<h2>The Present</h2>
<p>
    I've been working on my free time on a project called
    <a href="https://github.com/Hammer-Institute/hammer">Hammer</a>. It's a
    simple WebSocket-based chat app that also has an API for non real-time
    communication needs, eg, logging in, creating accounts, etc. It's a simple
    project, but I'm hoping to use it as a way to learn more about web
    development and to build a simple, but functional, chat app. I've been
    thinging about colleges. I applied only to in-state institutions, including
    but not limited to, Indiana University, Purdue University, Purdue Fort
    Wayne, Purdue Polytechnic Institute Anderson, IUPUI, and Ball State
    University. I ended up being admitted to IUPUI, BSU, PPA. I was waitlisted
    at IU Bloomington, however their deadline for getting back to me is June
    15th, which is after most colleges require enrollment deposits. It does suck
    that I got rejected from Purdue in West Lafeyette, but IUPUI is splitting up
    so my degree will end up saying that I "went" there. I recently decided to
    go to IUPUI, majoring in Motorsports Engineering. I'm excited to start
    school, but I'm also a bit nervous.

<h3>The Present, Continued</h3>
<p>
    I've just submitted my enrollment deposit to IUPUI. Which I guess does tie
    me down to going there. I'm excited to start school, especially in a cool
    major like Motorsports Engineering. I'm also excited to start working on my
    own projects again, now that I have more time to do so. I put Hammer on hold
    for a bit, and it did kinda suck.
</p>

<p>correction notice: (the funny joke is hours after writing this line about Motorsports Engineering, I changed my major to Mechanical Engineering)</p>

<p>
    Mini-Hammer update: I've been working on Hammer a bit more. I had to look over
    the codebase and make sure that it was all fresh in my mind. I've been
    working on the API, and I've been trying to figure out how to do the
    front-end. Before I last halted development, I was using React, but I'm
    not sure if I want to use it again. I was working out authentication again in my head,
    and I'm not sure if I like how I'm doing it. One big hurdle I'm facing is
    that I completely glossed over the fact that I'm not using a database. I
    was thinking that I could just throw one on after I got the API and socket server
    working, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to go about it.
</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>
    As previously stated, my "IUPUI", really "Purdue University
    <i>in Indianapolis</i>" diploma will end up saying is that I studied in West
    Lafayette, Indiana. So at least I'll have that going for me. I'm excited to
    start school, and move on from high school, especially with all the drama I
    had to deal with.
