			I have been a member of the Steel Eagles Robotics club for 3 years and am set to finish it out this year as a senior.
			On both of the two teams I've competed on (2019-2020 and 2020-2023), I have been the lead programmer and have been responsible for the design and implementation of the robot's autonomous and driver control code.
			On the second team I've been a member of, we have been tournament finalists twice and ranked high at almost every competition we've attended.<br />

			then stores that in another file.<br />
