            I was a member of the Steel Eagles Robotics (7701) club for 4 years
            during high school. We competed in the VEX Robotics Competition for
            4 years as a programmer and designer. My team worked hard in the
            incredibly difficult Indiana region and managed to qualify for the
            State Championship in 2023 and fell just short of qualifying for the
            World Championship.<br/>

            Simple chat server written in JS on both the client and server side.
            Uses WebSockets for all communication. I decided to use these
            technologies out of simplicity. I personally wrote all the code for
            the entire stack, authentication, socket, etc.<br/>

            Prototype datastore that takes in strings as arrays, stored in a
            json file. The keystore takes the string that the programmer inputs
            and stores it in a separate keystore JSON object with the location
            of the data in the data array, then stores that in another file.<br/>
