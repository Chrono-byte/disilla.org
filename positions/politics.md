> "Science isn't about **WHY**. It's about **WHY NOT**. Why is so much of our science dangerous? Why not marry safe science if you love it so much. In fact, why not invent a special safety door that won't hit you on the butt on the way out, because you are fired." — Cave Johnson (Portal 2)

## Elections

I believe that local elections (and eventually national) would greatly benefit from switching off the antiquated first-past-the-post system. Both the Democratic and Republican parties, nationally and state-level, are greatly disconnected from the average American.

## Ideologies

### Conservatism

I think there are some good ideas that some good ideas can come from right wing individuals, however, in the US many conservatives refuse to cede any ground

#### Neo-conservatives

I generally try not to wholely disregard groups, however from my engagement with many neo-cons online, I've come to fundamentally regard them as one of the single greatest threats to American democracy.

### Liberalism (As in left-wing)



#### Leftists

Individuals who fall further left than US liberals often are described (in US politics) as "leftists". Personally I believe this to be far to broad a term to have any meaningful
discussion about.

### "Omni-Liberalism"

In politics, it can be useful to know which particular ideology someone subscribes to. However, I do not fall perfectly in-line with any particular ideology. I describe myself as an *Omni-Liberal*, which is a made-up, tongue-in-cheek term to encapsulate the general position of:

1. Having the core values of liberalism (e.g. freedom and equality).
2. Taking the best parts of all different kinds of political ideologies and using them together in a pragmatic way.

Omni-liberalism was created by [Destiny](https://destiny.gg), an online political streamer who's communities I frequent.

#### Changing economic systems

I don't feel dogmatically attached to any particular form of government or economic system. If it can be demonstrated that some economic system (socialism, capitalism, etc.) can consistently produce better economic and social outcomes for a given society, that would be the economic system I would advocate for. As of right now, I believe that free markets with strong social safety nets (see: [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model)) are the most effective way of achieving these ends.

### Capitalism

> "We Shouldn't Fear Change Itself." — Misty (Cyberpunk 2077)

I consider myself to be a [capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism).

At a high-level, capitalism seems to be the best-known economic system to generate wealth. I believe the responsibility of any economic system should, first and foremost, be to allocate resources in an economy as efficiently as possible to create the largest possible base from which to draw taxes to redistribute to those who need it most. I recognize in many western countries, especially the United States, we seem to have a big problem with the "redistribution" part.

There are different kinds of capitalism, ranging all the way from *[laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire)* (e.g. [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market)) to [state capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism) (e.g. [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism#Mainland_China)). Completely free-market systems have serious downsides (e.g. monopolies, unequal bargaining power) and don't properly account for negative externalities (e.g. pollution, global warming) without government intervention. Thus, I believe that capitalism should be tempered by a strong government that tries to correct for these problems, similar to how Nordic countries function. Not surprisingly, this is the economic model of nearly all advanced economies in the West.

### Populism

> “It is fatal to look hungry. It makes people want to kick you.” ― George Orwell, Down and Out in Paris and London

I do not support [populism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism).

Populism is usually defined as "the people" versus "the elites." This happens on both the right (e.g. the alt-right & Donald Trump) and the left (e.g. Bernie-or-Busters). Populism is powerful because it feeds off negative emotions, but is often not based on facts.

### Socialism / Communism

> "Truth And Good Are Values Proven To Cause Division." — Delamain (Cyberpunk 2077)

I do not support [socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) or [communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism). I believe that these systems are fundamentally flawed and have been proven to be ineffective at producing wealth and improving the lives of the people. Many people online fundamentally refuse to accept this, and I believe that this is a big part of the reason why the left is so divided.
